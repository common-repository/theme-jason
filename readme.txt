The secret sauce to using all the fun styles on themejason.com.

== Description ==

Theme Jason has partnered with some of the best designers in the world to provide you with unique style options for most popular WordPress themes. To make this as easy as possible we needed a few features that weren't in WordPress (yet) so we decided instead of making your wait until WordPress caught up with us we'd develop those features ourselves and put them in a plugin.

These features include:
* The ability to import/export global style settings
* The ability to add fonts from Google Fonts

== Frequently Asked Questions =

= Why do I need this? =

When you go [ThemeJason.com](https://themejason.com) you'll be able to download various style packs that will help you turn your boring themes into something you'll fall in love with. Normally if you want to change your style in the WordPress Global Styles interface you have to click a bunch of buttons and enter a bunch of information. With this plugin and the style packs found on [ThemeJason.com](https://themejason.com) you can accomplish all that work with two clicks of the mouse.
